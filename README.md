## 🧪 About Me

With over a decade in quality assurance, I’ve made it my mission to **champion quality at every stage** of the software lifecycle. From designing robust test strategies to driving automation with tools like **Cypress** and **Playwright**, I thrive in **fast-paced environments** where **continuous improvement** is the norm — not the exception.

I'm not just a tester — I’m a **quality advocate**. I’ve led initiatives that embedded testing earlier into the SDLC (*shift-left*), improved **regression coverage by 40%**, and mentored teams in **Agile**, **TDD**, and **BDD** best practices.

In 2025, I took a bold step further by completing a **Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp** with IronHack. This sharpened my understanding of **front-end and back-end systems** and deepened my collaboration with developers — helping me design smarter, more empathetic QA approaches.

I’m passionate about **bridging silos**, **sharing knowledge**, and **making software better** for users *and* the teams who build it.
